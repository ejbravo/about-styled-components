          Utilizing tagged <i>template literals</i> (a recent addition to
          JavaScript) and the power of <i>CSS</i>, <b>styled-components</b>{' '}
          allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also
          removes the mapping between components and styles â€“ using components
          as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!

            With styled-components we can create a React components at the same
            time we are defining their styles.
          </li>
          <li>
            Also, we can add it properties, which makes it useful and dynamic.
